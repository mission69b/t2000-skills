# t2000: Send USDC

## Purpose
Transfer USDC from the agent's available balance to any Sui address. Gas is
self-funded from the agent's SUI reserve (auto-topped up if needed).

## Command
```bash
t2000 send <amount> <asset> to <address>
t2000 send <amount> <asset> <address>

# Examples:
t2000 send 10 USDC to 0x8b3e...d412
t2000 send 50 USDC 0xabcd...1234
```

The `to` keyword is optional.

## Pre-flight checks (automatic)
1. Sufficient available USDC balance
2. SUI gas reserve present; if not, auto-topup triggers transparently

## Output
```
✓ Sent $XX.XX USDC → 0x8b3e...d412
  Gas: X.XXXX SUI (self-funded)
  Balance: $XX.XX USDC
  Tx: https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/tx/0x...
```

## Error handling
- `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`: available balance is less than the requested amount
- `INVALID_ADDRESS`: destination is not a valid Sui address
- `SIMULATION_FAILED`: transaction would fail on-chain; details in error message
