# t2000: Check Balance

## Purpose
Fetch the current balance across all accounts: available USDC,
savings (NAVI), gas reserve (SUI), and total value.

## Commands
```bash
t2000 balance                 # human-readable summary
t2000 balance --show-limits   # includes maxWithdraw, maxBorrow, healthFactor
t2000 balance --json          # machine-parseable JSON (works on all commands)
```

## Output (default)
```
Available:  $150.00  (checking — spendable)
Savings:    $2,000.00  (earning 5.10% APY)
Gas:        0.50 SUI    (~$0.50)
──────────────────────────────────────
Total:      $2,150.50
Earning ~$0.27/day
```

## Output (--show-limits)
Appends to the above:
```
Limits:
  Max withdraw:   $XX.XX
  Max borrow:     $XX.XX
  Health factor:  X.XX          (∞ if no active loan)
```

## Notes
- `gasReserve.usdEquiv` is an estimate at current SUI price; it fluctuates
- If balance shows $0.00 available and wallet was just created, fund it first
  via Coinbase Onramp or a direct USDC transfer to the wallet address
- `--json` is a global flag that works on all t2000 commands, not just balance
