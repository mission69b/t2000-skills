  Deposit USDC into savings to earn yield on Sui via NAVI or Suilend
  (auto-selects best rate). Use when asked to save money, earn interest,
  deposit to savings, or put funds to work. Only accepts USDC — rebalance
  handles multi-stablecoin optimization internally.
  Not for sending to other addresses — use t2000-send for that.

# t2000: Save (Deposit to Savings)

## Purpose
Deposit USDC into savings to earn yield (auto-selects best rate across
NAVI and Suilend, or specify `--protocol navi|suilend`). Funds remain
non-custodial and withdrawable at any time.

## Command
```bash
t2000 save <amount> [--protocol <name>]
t2000 save all

# Examples:
t2000 save 80
t2000 save all
t2000 save 50 --protocol suilend
```

- `save all`: deposits full USDC balance minus $1 reserve for gas
- Rebalance may internally move savings to other stablecoins for better yield

## Fees
- Protocol fee: 0.1% on deposit (collected atomically on-chain)

## Output
```
✓ Gas manager: $1.00 USDC → SUI          [only shown if auto-topup triggered]
✓ Saved $XX.XX USDC to best rate
✓ Current APY: X.XX%
✓ Savings balance: $XX.XX USDC
  Tx: https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/tx/0x...
```

## Notes
- APY is variable based on protocol utilization
- If available balance is $0 after gas conversion, returns INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE
- `t2000 supply` is an alias for `t2000 save`
- Use `t2000 rebalance` to auto-optimize yield across protocols and stablecoins
