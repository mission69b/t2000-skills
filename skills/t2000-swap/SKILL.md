  Swap tokens on Sui via Cetus Aggregator (20+ DEXs, best-route across SUI,
  USDC, USDsui, USDT, USDe, ETH, GOLD, NAVX, WAL, vSUI, and more). Use when
  asked to swap, trade, convert, exchange, or "turn X into Y". Do not use
  for sending — use the t2000-send skill for transfers.

# t2000: Swap Tokens

## Purpose

Convert between tokens at the best available rate. Cetus Aggregator routes across 20+ DEXs and picks the lowest-price-impact path. Slippage defaults to 1%; configurable up to 5%.

**Swaps are NOT gasless.** Unlike `t2 send USDC` / `t2 send USDsui`, Cetus swap transactions require SUI for gas (typically < $0.01 per swap). Ensure the wallet holds a small SUI balance before swapping.

## Rules

1. **Preview before signing.** Always run `t2 swap <amount> <from> <to> --quote` (or call `t2000_swap` in dry-run via the MCP) and surface `priceImpact` + `toAmount` to the user before broadcasting.
2. **Decline obviously bad swaps.** If `priceImpact > 0.5%` (50 bps), warn the user and require explicit confirmation. If `priceImpact > 5%`, refuse — that's almost certainly a thin-liquidity trap.
3. **One swap per intent.** Cetus aggregator handles multi-hop internally; don't chain `swap` calls.
4. **Don't auto-decide stables.** If the user says "swap to USD", ASK whether USDC or USDsui — they're both Sui-native stables.
5. **Limits apply to every swap (CLI and MCP).** Limits are on by default ($25/tx · $100/day); if the swap exceeds a cap (on the from-side USD value) the write throws `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`. Use `--force` (CLI) to override one time.

## Command

```bash
t2 swap <amount> <from> <to> [--slippage <pct>] [--quote] [--force]

# Examples:
t2 swap 100 USDC SUI                  # 100 USDC → SUI, default 1% slippage
t2 swap 5 SUI USDC --slippage 2       # 5 SUI → USDC, 2% slippage
t2 swap 50 USDC USDsui                # stable-to-stable; usually <0.05% impact
t2 swap 100 USDC SUI --quote          # preview only (no signing)
```

Slippage is capped at 5% (any higher is rejected — that's degenerate liquidity).

## Preview (`--quote`)

```bash
t2 swap 100 USDC SUI --quote
```

Returns (no signing, no execution):
- `toAmount` — estimated output (at current pool state)
- `priceImpact` — basis points moved by the trade
- `route` — provider name(s) Cetus selected (e.g. BLUEFIN + CETUS + AFTERMATH)
- `fee` — total Cetus protocol fee baked into the quote

`--quote` replaces the v3 `t2000 swap-quote` standalone command. One verb, one flag.

## Fees

- **Network gas:** ~0.001-0.01 SUI per swap (self-funded from the wallet).
- **Cetus protocol fee:** typically 0.05-0.30% depending on the pool tier (already baked into `toAmount`).
- **t2000 / CLI:** zero fee. Audric (consumer product) adds a 10 bps overlay fee — that's separate, not charged by the CLI.

## Output (default)

```
✓ Swapped 100 USDC for 49.8721 SUI
  Price impact:  0.04%
  Route:         USDC → SUI (Cetus + BLUEFIN)
  Gas:           0.0038 SUI
  Tx:            https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/tx/0xdigest...
```

## Output (--json)

```json
{
  "tx": "0xdigest...",
  "from": "USDC",
  "to": "SUI",
  "amountIn": 100,
  "amountOut": 49.8721,
  "priceImpact": 0.04,
  "route": ["CETUS", "BLUEFIN"],
  "fee": 0.001,
  "gasCost": 0.0038
}
```

## Error handling

| Error code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SWAP_NO_ROUTE` | No path from `from` to `to` in Cetus's pool graph. Suggest going via USDC as an intermediate. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY` | The requested size moves the pool too far. Suggest a smaller trade or splitting. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Wallet doesn't hold enough of the source token (after gas reserve). |
| `INSUFFICIENT_GAS` | Wallet has the source token but no SUI for gas. Run `t2 swap 1 USDC SUI` (or similar) first to top up gas. |
| `SLIPPAGE_EXCEEDED` | By the time the tx confirmed, the pool moved past the slippage limit. Retry with the same params; usually transient. |
| `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | CLI hit a `t2 limit set` cap on the from-side USD value. Use `--force` to override. |

## Supported tokens

USDC, USDsui, USDT, USDe, SUI, vSUI, ETH, GOLD (XAUM), NAVX, WAL, and the long tail Cetus routes through. Use the canonical symbol or pass a full coin type (`0x...::module::TYPE`). The `@t2000/sdk` token registry resolves common symbols automatically; for a coin type **not** in the registry the decimals are read **on-chain** (coin metadata) so the input amount is exact — never a guess.

## When called through MCP (`t2000_swap` tool)

```json
{
  "from": "USDC",
  "to": "SUI",
  "amount": 100,
  "slippage": 0.01
}
```

- Both CLI and MCP swaps honor `t2 limit set` caps (enforced in `@t2000/sdk`, on the from-side USD value). Default caps: $25/tx · $100/day cumulative.
- Returns the same shape as `--json` mode (digest + amounts + price impact + route).

## What NOT to do

- Don't auto-execute multi-leg flows ("swap A → B → C in three transactions"). If a multi-hop is needed, Cetus does it internally as one PTB.
- Don't recommend swapping mid-position rebalance without first surfacing impermanent-loss risk if the user asked for advice.
- Don't swap to a stable just to "park" funds with no plan — explain that the Agent Wallet is wallet-first; savings yield lives on audric.ai.
