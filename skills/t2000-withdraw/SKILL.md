# t2000: Withdraw from Savings

## Purpose
Withdraw USDC from savings back to your checking balance.

## Command
```bash
t2000 withdraw <amount>
t2000 withdraw all

# Examples:
t2000 withdraw 25
t2000 withdraw all
```

## Fees
- No protocol fee on withdrawals

## Output
```
✓ Withdrew $XX.XX USDC
  Tx: https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/tx/0x...
```

## Safety
If there's an active borrow, t2000 checks the health factor before
withdrawing. If the withdrawal would drop HF below 1.5, it throws
`WITHDRAW_WOULD_LIQUIDATE` with a `safeWithdrawAmount`.

## Error handling
- `WITHDRAW_WOULD_LIQUIDATE`: withdrawal would make health factor unsafe. Check `safeWithdrawAmount` in error data.
- `NO_COLLATERAL`: no savings to withdraw
- `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`: requested amount exceeds savings balance
